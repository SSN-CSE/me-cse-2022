| CODE | COURSE TITLE           | L | T | P | C |
|      | FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING | 3 | 0 | 0 | 3 |

** COURSE OBJECTIVES
1. To write small to medium-sized functional programs for a
   variety of applications
2. To exploit a variety of programming techniques typical in
   functional programming such as use of recursion, modelling
   with recursive datatypes, abstraction and reuse with the
   help of higher order functions and monads
3. To appreciate the strengths and possible weaknesses of the
   functional programming paradigm

** COURSE OUTCOMES
After the completion of this course, students will be able to
1. Explain the basics of functional programming and write programs in a functional style (K2)
2. Use lists, recursion, and higher order functions (K3)
3. Apply polymorphism and higher-order functions (K3)
4. Separate stateful functions using monads and apply them for problem solving (K3)
5. Use infinite data structures and reason formally about
   functional programs (K3)
