** Course Objectives
- To understand the various attacks.
- To study about an essential of computer security.
- To acquire knowledge on TCP/IP security, firewalls, IPSec, Virtual
  Private Networks, intrusion detection systems.
- To understand how various security mechanisms work, and correlate
  these security mechanisms with security principles.
- To apply security principles to solve problems.
