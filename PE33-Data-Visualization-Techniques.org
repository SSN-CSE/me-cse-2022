** Course Objectives
- To introduce visual perception and core skills for visual analysis.
- To visualize time-series, part-to-whole and ranking Analysis patterns.
- To analyze the deviation and distribution of data in real time. 
- To analyze correlation and multivariate patterns of data. 
- To understand issues and best practices in information dashboard design.
